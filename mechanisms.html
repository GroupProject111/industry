                <h2>2-step verification (2SV)</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>2-step verification (2SV) - It is a way of double checking that you are the person claiming to be while using online
                        services such as online
                        banking, email or social media.
                        The second step of authentication is something that only you can access, for example a code sent to your email or
                        text
                        message.
                        Using 2SV you can protect your online account even when your password is stolen.</p></div>

            <h4>Types of 2SV:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Text messages:</li>
                <p>Most providers, by default, offer 2SV over text message.
                    You submit your phone number during signup, and the service will send you a message with the code to use.
                    If you choose, certain services can also send a code through voice message.</p>
                <p>Text messages aren't the most secure sort of 2SV, but they're still better than not using any at all.</p>
                <p>Remember: Any 2-step verification is better than not having it at all</p>
                <li>Authentication Apps</li>
                <p>Text messages are largely replaced by authenticator apps on your smartphone (or tablet).</p>
                <p>This sort of app includes Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
                <p>You may use the same programme to set up 2SV on any accounts that have this option once you've installed one.
                </p>
                <p>These apps have numerous advantages over text messaging, including not needing a mobile signal or having to
                    wait for the
                    text message to arrive.</p>
                <li>Backup codes</li>
                <p>When you turn on 2SV, some accounts also provide you a list of backup codes.</p>
                <p>You can use one of these when prompted for a code, but each code will only work once, so you'll need to make
                    more
                    once
                    you've used them all.
                    Backup codes come in handy when you don't have access to your phone.
                    The codes must be kept somewhere safe.</p>

                                        <p>A backup is a copy of your data that is stored in a separate location, usually on internet (cloud) or removable media
                                        (USB stick, SD card). After making a backup you can restore your data if you lose an access to your original data.
                                        You should backup anything you value - documents, photos, videos or entire content of your phone or computer.
                                        Everyone who is available to access your cloud will be able to access your backup data, remember to use strong password
                                        and 2SV to protect your clous storage.</p>

                                    <p>Security updates will help protect your devices and accounts from cyber criminals. You should update your apps and your
                                    device's software as soon as they are available. Those updates include protection from viruses and other kinds of
                                    malware, and usually include new features and updates.
                                    The best way to do is to tur on "automatic updates" feature in your device's settings, if that option is available.
                                    Applying updates is one of the most important things you can do to stay safe online.</p>
