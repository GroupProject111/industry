		<p> Mitigating privacy isn’t as complicated as it sounds. It is simply the process of ensuring that your privacy and security risks are at the minimal extent possible. An example of this can be installing anti-virus software to continually monitor potential system threats. A risk assessment is the best place to start. This will assist you in identifying and prioritizing the assets that are the most dangerous to your company. After that, you'll need to start looking for weaknesses.</p>

                    	   <h4>TYPES OF THREATS THAT OCCUR FROM LACK OF PRIVACY MITIGATION </h4>
				
				
			 <ul>
      <li>Phishing Attacks
					<ul>
						<li>When attackers send deceptive emails to deceive others into falling for a fraud, this is known as phishing. Getting people to expose financial information, system passwords, or other sensitive data is a common incentive. </li>
						<li>Phishing is a form of social engineering, which is a set of tactics used by con artists to manipulate human psychology. Forgery, misdirection, and lying are all social engineering strategies that can be used in phishing attempts. Phishing emails, at their most basic level, employ social engineering to get participants to behave without thinking things through.</li>
					</ul>
     <li>SQL injections
					<ul>
						<li>Sql injections enable hackers to impersonate identity, interfere with previous data, cause repudiation concerns such as nullifying transactions or altering balances, allow full disclosure of any and all data on the system, delete the information or make it otherwise inaccessible, and gain access to system server's administrators.</li>
					</ul>
     <li>Malware
                    <ul>
                          <li>a file or code, generally supplied across a network, that infects, investigates, steals, or performs nearly any action desired by the attacker And, because ransomware comes in so many varieties, there are numerous ways to attack computer systems.</li>
                    </ul>    
	     <li>STATISTICS:
                    <ul>
                          <li> By 2023, 65% of the world’s population will have its personal information covered under modern privacy regulations, up from 10% today. </li>
                    </ul> 
             <li>MORE STATS
                    <ul>
                          <li>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercrime as a whole has increased by 600 percent. </li>
                    </ul>

				<ol>
 					 <li>Establish a multifunctional team led by senior staff to identify privacy and security concerns, determine priorities, and regulate accessibility and disclosing policies.</li>
 					 <li>Undertake regular risk and control evaluations to detect holes in privacy and security. Update rules, processes, and technology to reflect this—specify who has access to what PHI and the regulations of what to do if breach occurs.</li>
 					 <li>Use the National Institute of Standards and Technology standard for data at rest and data in motion to encrypt all electronic information. If an unencrypted device, disc, or piece of data is lost or misplaced, the Office for Civil Rights assumes a HIPAA violation. Because the information cannot be accessed without a key, breach notification is not necessary.</li> 
					<li>Continuously provide enterprise-wide education and training to enhance awareness of corporate policies and processes, as well as relevant laws and regulations affecting PHI disclosure. Each training programme should be followed by an evaluation to determine its success.</li> 
					<li>Utilize technology to identify and prevent unwanted electronic data usage and transfer. There are applications available that constantly monitor software and system hardware for external threats and security issues. eg. anti virus software. While also  ensuring that privacy and security controls are managed effectively.</li>
